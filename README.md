# Spotify Fun

## Description

- Your friend wants to include music streaming as part of her online business idea. She's asked you to vet using Spotify instead of Apple music. You've agreed to help her out and demonstrate some useful things that can be done from the Spotify Web API.

## Things to do:

- Obtain a clientId and clientSecret from Spotify
- Determine how to get a user's profile data from the API
- Display on a local DOM a user's top tracks
- Apply some basic styling to the page
- Make sure the browser tab has a favicon
